    <h2>Why I Started Coding</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When people ask why I started coding, I often find myself reflecting on the journey that led me to this exciting new world.<br>
        It is a combination of curiosity, ambition, and the belief that it is never too late to learn something new.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        For as long as I can remember, I have always been curious about how things work, whether it was the mechanics of a machine, the artistry of a design, or, in this case, the technology that powers our modern lives.<br>
        I grew up surrounded by the beauty of Bali, a place rich in creativity and tradition, and that sense of exploration stayed with me as I transitioned to a new chapter of my life in Munich, Germany. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When I moved to Munich in 2023, I wanted to challenge myself in a way I never had before. Coding felt like the perfect challenge skill that combines problem-solving, creativity, and the potential to make a real impact.<br>
        It is a language of the future, one that connects people across the globe, and I wanted to be a part of it.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Another reason I started coding was the opportunity it offers to continuously learn and grow. Technology evolves so quickly, and with it comes the chance to stay curious and adapt.<br>
        As someone who has always been passionate about learning, coding feels like an adventure that never ends.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        But perhaps the most personal reason I started coding is my dream of working in the IT industry. I want to build solutions that matter, whether that is through websites, applications, or something I can not even imagine yet.<br>
        The thought of creating something from scratch, of turning an idea into reality with just a keyboard and some knowledge, is both empowering and exciting.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Of course, learning to code is not without its challenges. I have had moments of doubt, frustration, and even confusion. But those moments are outweighed by the thrill of getting something to work for the first time, no matter how small.<br>
        It is those tiny victories that remind me why I started and keep me moving forward.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences, from the challenges I face to the joy of overcoming them.<br>
        I also hope it inspires others to start their own journeys, whether in coding or in something else they have always dreamed of.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Starting to code is about more than just learning a technical skillâ€”it is about opening the door to a world of possibilities.<br>
        For me, it is the beginning of a new chapter, and I could not be more excited to see where it takes me.
